  "description": "ArbitraryFSAccessThroughSMsConfig enables users to configure, whether a service scrape selected by the vmagent instance is allowed to use arbitrary files on the file system of the vmagent container. This is the case when e.g. a service scrape specifies a BearerTokenFile in an endpoint. A malicious user could create a service scrape selecting arbitrary secret files in the vmagent container. Those secrets would then be sent with a scrape request by vmagent to a malicious target. Denying the above would prevent the attack, users can instead use the BearerTokenSecret field.",
