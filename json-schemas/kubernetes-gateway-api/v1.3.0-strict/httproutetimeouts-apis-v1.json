If the gateway has not been able to respond before this deadline is met, the gateway MUST return a timeout error.\n\nFor example, setting the `rules.timeouts.request` field to the value `10s` in an `HTTPRoute` will cause a timeout if a client request is taking longer than 10 seconds to complete.\n\nSetting a timeout to the zero duration (e.g. \"0s\") SHOULD disable the timeout completely. Implementations that cannot completely disable the timeout MUST instead interpret the zero duration as the longest possible value to which the timeout can be set.\n\nThis timeout is intended to cover as close to the whole request-response transaction as possible although an implementation MAY choose to start the timeout after the entire request stream has been received instead of immediately after the transaction is initiated by the client.\n\nThe value of Request is a Gateway API Duration string as defined by GEP-2257.
