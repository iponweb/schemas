If any retry attempts are still in progress when the Request timeout duration has been reached, these SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway MUST immediately return a timeout error.\n\nIf a BackendRequest timeout (`rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`) is configured on the route, any retry attempts which reach the configured BackendRequest timeout duration without a response SHOULD be canceled if possible and the Gateway should wait for at least the specified backoff duration before attempting to retry the backend request again.\n\nIf a BackendRequest timeout is _not_ configured on the route, retry attempts MAY time out after an implementation default duration, or MAY remain pending until a configured Request timeout or implementation default duration for total request time is reached.\n\nWhen this field is unspecified, the time to wait between retry attempts is implementation-specific.\n\nSupport: Extended",
