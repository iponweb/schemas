If multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status.\n\nFor example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is invalid, 50 percent of traffic MUST receive an `UNAVAILABLE` status. Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.\n\nSupport: Core for Kubernetes Service\n\nSupport: Implementation-specific for any other resource\n\nSupport for weight: Core",

In cases where incompatible or unsupported filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify this configuration error.\n\nSupport: Core",

Merging MUST not be done between GRPCRoutes and HTTPRoutes. Precedence MUST be given to the rule with the largest number of:\n\n* Characters in a matching non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. * Characters in a matching service. * Characters in a matching method. * Header matches.\n\nIf ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:\n\n* The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by\n  \"{namespace}/{name}\".\n\nIf ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence, matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching rule meeting the above criteria.",
