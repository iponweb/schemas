      "description": "BackendRefs defines the backend(s) where matching requests should be sent.\n\nFailure behavior here depends on how many BackendRefs are specified and how many are invalid.\n\nIf *all* entries in BackendRefs are invalid, and there are also no filters specified in this route rule, *all* traffic which matches this rule MUST receive a 500 status code.\n\nSee the HTTPBackendRef definition for the rules about what makes a single HTTPBackendRef invalid.\n\nWhen a HTTPBackendRef is invalid, 500 status codes MUST be returned for requests that would have otherwise been routed to an invalid backend. If multiple backends are specified, and some are invalid, the proportion of requests that would otherwise have been routed to an invalid backend MUST receive a 500 status code.\n\nFor example, if two backends are specified with equal weights, and one is invalid, 50 percent of traffic must receive a 500. Implementations may choose how that 50 percent is determined.\n\nWhen a HTTPBackendRef refers to a Service that has no ready endpoints, implementations SHOULD return a 503 for requests to that backend instead. If an implementation chooses to do this, all of the above rules for 500 responses MUST also apply for responses that return a 503.\n\nSupport: Core for Kubernetes Service\n\nSupport: Extended for Kubernetes ServiceImport\n\nSupport: Implementation-specific for any other resource\n\nSupport for weight: Core",

If implementations choose a strict interpretation of filter ordering, they MUST clearly document that behavior.\n\nTo reject an invalid combination or order of filters, implementations SHOULD consider the Route Rules with this configuration invalid. If all Route Rules in a Route are invalid, the entire Route would be considered invalid. If only a portion of Route Rules are invalid, implementations MUST set the \"PartiallyInvalid\" condition for the Route.\n\nConformance-levels at this level are defined based on the type of filter:\n\n- ALL core filters MUST be supported by all implementations. - Implementers are encouraged to support extended filters. - Implementation-specific custom filters have no API guarantees across\n  implementations.\n\nSpecifying the same filter multiple times is not supported unless explicitly indicated in the filter.\n\nAll filters are expected to be compatible with each other except for the URLRewrite and RequestRedirect filters, which may not be combined. If an implementation cannot support other combinations of filters, they must clearly document that limitation. In cases where incompatible or unsupported filters are specified and cause the `Accepted` condition to be set to status `False`, implementations may use the `IncompatibleFilters` reason to specify this configuration error.\n\nSupport: Core",

Across all rules specified on applicable Routes, precedence must be given to the match having:\n\n* \"Exact\" path match. * \"Prefix\" path match with largest number of characters. * Method match. * Largest number of header matches. * Largest number of query param matches.\n\nNote: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are implementation-specific.\n\nIf ties still exist across multiple Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on ties:\n\n* The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. * The Route appearing first in alphabetical order by\n  \"{namespace}/{name}\".\n\nIf ties still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST be granted to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with a match meeting the above criteria.\n\nWhen no rules matching a request have been successfully attached to the parent a request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned.",
