Subsequent entries with an equivalent header name MUST be ignored. Due to the case-insensitivity of header names, \"foo\" and \"Foo\" are considered equivalent.\n\nWhen a header is repeated in an HTTP request, it is implementation-specific behavior as to how this is represented. Generally, proxies should follow the guidance from the RFC: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230.html#section-3.2.2 regarding processing a repeated header, with special handling for \"Set-Cookie\".",
