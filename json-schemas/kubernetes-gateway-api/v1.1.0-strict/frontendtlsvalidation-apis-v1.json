Implementations MAY choose to support attaching multiple CA certificates to a Listener, but this behavior is implementation-specific.\n\nSupport: Core - A single reference to a Kubernetes ConfigMap with the CA certificate in a key named `ca.crt`.\n\nSupport: Implementation-specific (More than one reference, or other kinds of resources).\n\nReferences to a resource in a different namespace are invalid UNLESS there is a ReferenceGrant in the target namespace that allows the certificate to be attached. If a ReferenceGrant does not allow this reference, the \"ResolvedRefs\" condition MUST be set to False for this listener with the \"RefNotPermitted\" reason.",
