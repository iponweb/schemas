All\n  implementations supporting GRPCRoute MUST support core filters.\n\n- Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration defined by\n  \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\". Implementers\n  are encouraged to support extended filters.\n\n- Implementation-specific: Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.\n  In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior across multiple\n  implementations will be considered for inclusion in extended or core\n  conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration for such filters\n  is specified using the ExtensionRef field. `Type` MUST be set to\n  \"ExtensionRef\" for custom filters.\n\nImplementers are encouraged to define custom implementation types to extend the core API with implementation-specific behavior.\n\nIf a reference to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have been processed by that filter MUST receive a HTTP error response.\n\n<gateway:experimental:validation:Enum=ResponseHeaderModifier;RequestHeaderModifier;RequestMirror;ExtensionRef>",
