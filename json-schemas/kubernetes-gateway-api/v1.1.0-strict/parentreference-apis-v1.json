For example: Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.\n\n<gateway:experimental:description> ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service.\n\nParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a ParentRef of the Route. </gateway:experimental:description>\n\nSupport: Core",

For example, Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname.
