      "description": "AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be present.\n\nAlthough a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria:\n\n* The most specific match as defined by the Route type. * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with\n  a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over\n  a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".\n* If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in\n  alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For\n  example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.\n\nAll valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid, support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest of the rules within that Route should still be supported.\n\nSupport: Core",

      "description": "Hostname specifies the virtual hostname to match for protocol types that define this concept. When unspecified, all hostnames are matched. This field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based matching.\n\nImplementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of the following protocols:\n\n* TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI. * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request. * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP\n  protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not\n  ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname,\n  it MUST clearly document that.\n\nFor HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames, there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames documentation.\n\nHostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.\n\nSupport: Core",
